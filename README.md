# Glyphr Studio Test Drive
 This is a stand-alone implementation of the Glyphr Studio Test Drive experience.  If you have a Glyphr 
 Studio project file (.txt) and your own web server, you can host an interactive Test Drive page where 
 people can play with your font (without having to export to an actual font file).

## Setup
Setup is pretty simple:
 - First, copy the files from the /app/ folder from this project to wherever you 
will be hosting this Test Drive.
 - From Glyphr Studio, save a Glyphr Studio Project File (.txt)
 - Open this text file in a text editor, and add ```_UI.font = ``` to the very begining of the file
 -- We're working on fixing this, it's kind of a hack
 - Save your text file as 'font.js', overwriting the sample font.js in the /app/ folder

 If you want, you can go into settings.js and change the sampletext to something other than 'hello'
